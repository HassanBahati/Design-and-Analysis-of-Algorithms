# linear search - sequential search or simple search

# STEPS
# 1 start at beginning of sorted/unsorted list 
# 2 compare current value and target value
# 3 if current value is target, return current value and terminate
# 4 if current value is not target, move to next value 
# repeate step 2

# Input - set of sorted/unsorted values 
# Output - value that matches one being looked for 

# time complexity - O(n)
