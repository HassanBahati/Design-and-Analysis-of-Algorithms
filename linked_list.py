# Linked list - linear data structure 
# Each element in the list is contained in a separate object called a Node 
# Node - contains individual item of the data and reference to the next node in the list  
# Head - first node in list 
# Tail - Last node in list 

# Nodes - are self referential objects - every node contains link to another node

# Singly Linked list - contains reference to next node in list 
# Doubly Linked List - contains reference to both the node previous and next node in the list
