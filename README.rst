Data Structure - A data storage format. It is a collection of values and the format they are stored in, the relationship between the values in the collection as well as the operations applied on the data stored in the structure.

 Operations on Data Structures
 - Access and read values 
 - Search for an arbitrary values
 - Insert values at any point into the structure
 - Delete values in the structure
 
 Each data structure solves a particular problem
 

# how to solve problems:
- State the problem clearlly. Identify the input and output formats.
- Come up with some example inputs and outputs. Try to cover all edges cases.
- Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plain English.
- implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs, if any.
- Analze the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiencies, if any.
- Apply the right technique to cover the inefficiency. Repeat steps 3 to 6.


Edge cases
1. the number query occurs somewhere in the middle of the list 
2.
